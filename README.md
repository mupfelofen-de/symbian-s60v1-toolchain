# Symbian S60v1 toolchain

A modern CMake toolchain for Symbian S60v1 devices such as the Nokia
N-Gage.

This project is part of a larger project aiming to create a functional
ecosystem for developing (or porting existing) games for the Nokia
N-Gage using modern and up-to-date tools such as Visual Studio 2019/2022
and CMake.

This toolchain is the core of this project and provides the basis for
all projects that build on it.

If you are interested in the Nokia N-Gage in general, you are cordially
invited to visit our small online community. You can find us on
